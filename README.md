# Coding responses for the Advent of Code challenge 2024

Find the coding challenges at: [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

All code for challenges is broken up by day and each day has two challenges. 

For each day, the code for the first challenge will be designated with an *a* and the code for the second challenge will be designated with a *b*.

Happy coding!
